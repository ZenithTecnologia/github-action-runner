# github-action-runner
A way to run github-action-runner on docker.

## Notes:

* Need a Personal access token (https://github.com/settings/tokens) with following permissions:
** admin:org, read:repo_hook

* Org must be the organization (User not tested but maybe work) and Token is the PAT. Runners are dinamically created and is not needed a runner deploy token.
